# What is Ruffins Generator? 

Internally we use a lot of Tailwind CSS. Nothing seems to beat Jinja/Alpine/Tailwind.
The opalstack homepage is built with a very similar stack to Ruffins. We wanted to provide 
a similar build experiance to our users which lead to the development of Ruffins Generator.
