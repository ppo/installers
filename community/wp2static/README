This script builds wp2static plugin which can be used to deploy a no-PHP copy of a WordPress site. 
Which can be useful for dealing with malware or large volumes of HTTP requests. 

To deploy this fix perform the following steps, 

1. Copy the build script to the server and give it execute permissions, 
`chmod +x build.sh`
2. Execute it. This should leave a zip file in `~/Downloads`. 
3. Install the Zip file via the plugin manager in WordPress. 
4. Configure the plugin. The most important setting to modify is the URL name. It should match the site URL. 
5. Generate the static content. 
6. Create symbolic link type apps for both the static path and wp-content. The static path will be `/home/YOU/apps/APPNAME/wp-content/uploads/wp2static-processed-site/`
7. Update the domain's site record to use the static app at the root URI '/' and the wp-content symlink app at `/wp-content/` URI

You should be done. If your site does not generate correctly, check the links in the rendered HTML.
