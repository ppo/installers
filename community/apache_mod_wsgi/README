This package includes 2 shell scripts and the directory schema required to build a Apache/mod_wsgi/Django1.8/Python2.7 stack.
They should be executed in a particular order. The required order is,

./build_apache.sh
source install_django.sh

After the builds are complete apache can be started/stopped with these commands,

./apache2/bin/apachectl start
./apache2/bin/apachectl stop
./apache2/bin/apachectl restart

Once the stack is installed all pythonic operations should be performed within the virtualenv.
This will not modify the shell environment beyond installing an updated pip2.7 in ~/local.
Its purpose is to init the venv.

 build_apache.sh
-----------------
This script builds apache and mod_wsgi. It will copy the default config into place.
The default config will not function without the install_django script being ran
or last mile configuration in the case of flask or another python based framework.

 install_django.sh
-------------------
This installs Django 1.8.7, which is the target LTS, and the best upgrade path to Python3.
It is also the best canidate for downgrading if you need a lower version.
It also builds the virtualenv and a default project wsgi file.
