# Opalstack Installers

Our application installers are built with shell script or python and interact with the platform via [JSON API](https://my.opalstack.com/api/v1/doc/)

Feel free to modify and use the code to build your own installers

If you would like one of your installers added to the repo plesae send us an email at support@opalstack.com
